# Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) Optimization using DEAP

## Problem Statement
The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a combinatorial optimization problem where a set of vehicles must deliver goods to a set of customers while minimizing the total travel cost. The objective is to determine the optimal set of routes for multiple vehicles originating from a central depot, ensuring all customers are visited while considering constraints such as vehicle capacity and time windows.

In this project, we implement an evolutionary algorithm using the DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python) library to optimize VRP solutions effectively.

## Prerequisites
Before running the optimization, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```sh
pip install deap numpy matplotlib

git clone https://github.com/Siddharth20mishra/VRP
cd vrp
python vrp_optimization.py
